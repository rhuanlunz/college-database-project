# Creating Database

To create the database, run the `setup.bat` script.

However, before executing it, you need to update the variable called `ISQL_EXECUTAVEL` by setting it to the full path of the Firebird `isql.exe` tool.

# 📕 Directory Structure

- `/migrations`: Scripts for database creation, insertion, and deletion.
- `/migrations/seed`: Scripts for data insertion.
- `/queries`: All SQL queries.

# 🧱 Database Model

I use [drawsql.app](https://drawsql.app) for modeling the database.
